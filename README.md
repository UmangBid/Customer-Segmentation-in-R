# Customer-Segmentation-in-R
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using K-means Clustering in R. It aims to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior, enabling businesses to target specific segments effectively.

Key Features:

1. Dataset: Mall_Customers.csv, containing data on 400 customers (age, gender, income, and spending scores).
2. Algorithms: Unsupervised learning with K-means clustering to group customers into optimal clusters.
3. Visualization: Bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and cluster visualizations with ggplot2.
4. Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enhance cluster visualization.

Project Workflow:

1. Data Exploration: Visualized customer demographics (age, gender distribution) and annual income patterns.
2. Cluster Optimization: Used the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
3. Clustering Analysis: Identified clusters based on spending scores and income levels.
Highlighted customer behaviors within each segment (e.g., high income, low spending).
4. Visualization of Results: Plotted cluster distributions using PCA components for an intuitive understanding.


Tools and Packages:

Platform: RStudio
Libraries: ggplot2, dplyr, cluster, factoextra, nbClust, gridExtra, and others.

Results:

Customers were grouped into meaningful clusters, such as high-income-high-spending and low-income-low-spending, offering actionable insights for marketing strategies.
